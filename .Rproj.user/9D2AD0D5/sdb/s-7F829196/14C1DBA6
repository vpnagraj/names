I'll do my best to keep this post from sounding like a sales pitch ... but **yes** it was awesome. I've built a handful of apps, and have even taught an introductory workshop on Shiny. In spite of that, almost all of the presentations de-mystified at least one aspect of the *how*, *when* or *so-what* of the framework. Here's a recap of what resonated with me, as well as some code / links out to my attempts to put what I digested into practice.\n\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
